Precision Discovery of Brain Biomarkers

This project is the repository for Danielle Steinbach's 3M YSC challenge project, called "Predibbio"
The aim is to apply deep neural networks to EEG data for Precision Diagnostics and Precision Medicine.
See website Predibbio.ai for more details

There are currently two DNN models in TensorFlow Keras:
a Precision Diagnostics model, and an autoencoder model used for unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering of EEG data
